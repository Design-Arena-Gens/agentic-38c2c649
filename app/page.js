        <h2>Who She Really Was</h2>
        <p>
          Agatha Christie (1890-1976) wasn't just a writer—she was a pharmacist's assistant during WWI, which is how she learned about poisons. That knowledge became her signature. While everyone knows her as the mystery novelist, few realize she was deeply unhappy in her first marriage, disappeared for 11 days in 1926 (a real-life mystery that's never been fully solved), and married an archaeologist 14 years younger than her for her second marriage.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wrote 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections. She's the best-selling novelist of all time—outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare. But here's what matters: she understood human psychology at a level most people don't reach. Her books aren't about the murders. They're about why people lie, cheat, and destroy each other.

        <h2>The Disappearance: What Actually Happened</h2>
        <p>
          December 1926. Agatha's mother died, her marriage was falling apart—her husband was having an affair. She vanished. Her car was found abandoned. Police launched a massive search with over 1,000 officers, volunteers, and even Arthur Conan Doyle got involved (he consulted a psychic).
        </p>
        <p>
          She was found 11 days later at a hotel, registered under her husband's mistress's surname. She claimed amnesia. The truth? Nobody knows. Some say it was a breakdown. Others say it was revenge—making her cheating husband the prime suspect in her "disappearance." She never spoke about it again.
        </p>
        <div className="fact-box">
          <strong>The Hidden Truth:</strong> This wasn't just drama. It was a woman who'd spent her life creating control through stories, suddenly losing all control of her real life. The disappearance was likely a dissociative episode—her mind protecting her from unbearable pain. She emerged from it, divorced, and rebuilt herself stronger.

        <h2>Her Two Greatest Creations</h2>

        <h3>Hercule Poirot</h3>
        <p>
          The Belgian detective with an ego the size of Belgium itself. Poirot isn't likable—he's vain, obsessive about his appearance, and insufferably smug. But that's the point. He represents pure logic, order in chaos. Christie actually grew tired of him and killed him off in "Curtain" (written in the 1940s but published in 1975). He got an obituary in The New York Times—the only fictional character to receive one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What most people miss:</strong> Poirot's method isn't about clues. It's about understanding human nature. He solves cases by knowing how people think when they're desperate, guilty, or greedy. He's a mirror showing us our own capacity for darkness.
        </p>

        <h3>Miss Marple</h3>
        <p>
          An elderly spinster from a small village who solves murders by comparing them to village gossip. Everyone underestimates her. That's her weapon. She's based on Christie's grandmother and her grandmother's friends—women society dismissed as irrelevant, but who saw everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The deeper truth:</strong> Miss Marple represents the power of being underestimated. She's the person in the corner nobody notices. She listens, observes, and understands that human nature doesn't change whether you're in a village or a mansion. Every crime is just a variation of something that's happened before.

        <h2>Essential Books (And Why They Matter)</h2>

        <div className="fact-box">
          <h3>Murder on the Orient Express (1934)</h3>
          <p>
            A murder on a train. Twelve suspects. The solution breaks every rule of detective fiction. This isn't about who did it—it's about justice vs. law. Christie asks: What do you do when the legal system fails? Can murder ever be justified? It's uncomfortable because she doesn't give you an easy answer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="fact-box">
          <h3>And Then There Were None (1939)</h3>
          <p>
            Ten people invited to an island. All guilty of crimes they escaped justice for. One by one, they die. No detective. No escape. This is Christie at her darkest. It's about guilt, conscience, and the fact that we all carry secrets that would destroy us if exposed. The original title was offensive (a racial slur)—it was changed, but that historical context matters.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="fact-box">
          <h3>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1926)</h3>
          <p>
            The most controversial ending in mystery history. People called it cheating. It's brilliant. Christie broke the unspoken rules of the genre, and in doing so, showed that truth can come from the most unexpected places. This book is about trust—who you trust as a reader, who characters trust, and how that trust can be weaponized.

        <h2>What She Actually Teaches You</h2>

        <p><strong>1. People Are Predictable When Desperate</strong></p>
        <p>
          Every Christie murder happens because someone feels trapped. Financial ruin, reputation at stake, love turned sour. When people feel cornered, they become dangerous. Learn to spot desperation in real life—it's the warning sign before someone does something stupid.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. The Mundane Detail Is Everything</strong></p>
        <p>
          Christie's solutions often hinge on small inconsistencies—someone who claimed they couldn't hear actually responded to a whisper, a left-handed person using their right hand, a clock showing the wrong time. Pay attention to details. When something doesn't add up, there's usually a reason.
        </p>

        <p><strong>3. Everyone Lies, But Why They Lie Matters</strong></p>
        <p>
          In Christie's books, almost everyone lies about something—but most aren't the murderer. They're hiding affairs, debts, embarrassing secrets. The skill isn't detecting lies. It's understanding which lies matter. Same applies to life. People bullshit constantly. Learn to distinguish between protective lies and malicious ones.
        </p>

        <p><strong>4. The Person Everyone Trusts Is Often the Most Dangerous</strong></p>
        <p>
          Doctors, priests, close friends—Christie's murderers are frequently people with authority or intimacy. They use trust as a weapon. Be skeptical of people who demand blind trust. Real trustworthy people earn it through consistency, not through position or charm.
        </p>

        <p><strong>5. Motive + Opportunity + Nerve</strong></p>
        <p>
          Christie's formula: someone needs a reason to kill (motive), the chance to do it (opportunity), and the psychological capacity to go through with it (nerve). Apply this to any situation where someone might betray you or act against your interests. If all three align, protect yourself.

        <h2>The Uncomfortable Stuff Nobody Talks About</h2>

        <p>
          Christie's early books contain racist language and stereotypes—especially about Jewish people, Italians, and people of color. Some books have been edited in modern editions. This isn't about canceling her. It's about understanding that brilliant people can still carry the prejudices of their time. Read her work critically. Appreciate the craft while acknowledging the flaws.
        </p>

        <p>
          She also had a weird fascination with poison—particularly arsenic and cyanide. Her pharmacy background meant she knew exactly how these substances worked. Some scholars argue she romanticized murder by making it seem clever and sophisticated rather than brutal and messy. Fair criticism.

      <div className="section">
        <h2>Why This Matters For You</h2>

        <p>
          Reading Christie isn't about solving fictional murders. It's about training yourself to think systematically about human behavior. Why do people act the way they do? What are they hiding? What are their incentives?
        </p>

        <p>
          In real life, you won't encounter murderers (probably). But you'll encounter manipulators, liars, people playing social games, and situations where something seems off but you can't pinpoint why. Christie teaches you to trust that instinct and dig deeper.
        </p>

        <p>
          She also teaches you about justice vs. revenge, law vs. morality, and the fact that sometimes the "right" answer isn't clean or satisfying. Life is ambiguous. Her best books sit in that ambiguity without flinching.
        </p>

        <div className="fact-box">
          <strong>Start here:</strong> Read "And Then There Were None" first. No detective to hold your hand. Just you, ten suspects, and a body count. If that hooks you, move to "Murder on the Orient Express." Then dive into "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" and let it mess with your expectations.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p>
          Agatha Christie wrote in a time when women weren't taken seriously as intellectuals. She became the best-selling novelist in history by understanding human psychology better than most trained psychiatrists. She survived a public breakdown, rebuilt her life, and created a body of work that's still relevant nearly 50 years after her death.
        </p>

        <p>
          The lesson isn't about solving mysteries. It's about resilience, observation, and the fact that understanding people—their fears, desires, and breaking points—is one of the most valuable skills you can develop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't just read her books. Study how she constructs them. Notice the misdirection, the psychological insights, the way she makes you suspect everyone before revealing the truth was hiding in plain sight.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's the real skill: seeing what's actually there, not what you expect to see.
